# Chance of Colleges 
An android application that suggests colleges for choice filling in the counseling process after JEE exam for admission to various Engineering Colleges for UG in India in JAVA.

# Motivation
Students Have to manually sort and arrange the list of colleges that can offer a seat based on their rank and preferences while counseling for admission to Engineering Colleges on the JoSAA portal,so we felt a need for an automated system for the same.

  3)College Profile Details
  
# Technology and Tools Used:
