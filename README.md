App Name : Chance of Colleges 
# Motivation
Have to manually sort and arrange the list of colleges that can offer a seat based on our rank and preferences while counseling for admission to Engineering Colleges on the JoSAA portal, 
Felt need for an automated system for the same.
Decided to design an application that will help students in Choice Filling for counseling following competitive exams for admission to various Engineering Colleges for Undergraduates in India (IITs, IIITs, NITs, and GFTIs).

# Idea: Designing an application that can offer functionalities like: 

  1)Rank Prediction
  2)College Prediction (IITs/NITs/others)
  3)College Profile Details
  
# Technology and Tools Used:
  1)Android Studio
  2)FireBase for Database
